[Data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data. 

**DataLab** at [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/) pursues data-driven research in the areas of [health informatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_informatics), [science of science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metascience), and [suicidology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicidology). We have been applying data science technologies to data from various domains such as publications, healthcare, social media, and data in various forms including but not limited to relational data, text data, graph data, and electronic health records data.
